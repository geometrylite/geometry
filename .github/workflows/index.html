              <h3>
                <span>Jump to the Rhythm with This Additive Game!</span>
              </h3>
              <p>
                <span>There are not so many games that can give players more amazing experiences than Geometry Lite! Based on the extremely popular platform-rhythm game Geometry Dash, Geometry Lite is a love letter from the fans of the original game. This game features everything you adore about the OG Geometry Dash, from catchy music and colorful platforms to extremely hard (and frustrating) gameplay! However, we all know the immense satisfaction of finishing a level after countless attempts. Try out Geometry Lite, now available online!</span>
              </p>
              <h3>
                <span>Gameplay Basics</span>
              </h3>
              <p>
                <span>While there are many levels available with various difficulties, your main objective is to navigate your character through numerous obstacles, including spikes and walls. Whenever you collide with any obstacle, the level resets, and you will have to start from the beginning&mdash;expect to have countless attempts when trying to clear the level!</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Each level has its own track, and its beat may serve as rhythm clues so you can time your jump. Accompanying the amazing music is the colorful animation, which also changes according to the beat. As you progress, more forms of the character will appear, each with their own distinctive functions and controls, making the gameplay feel fresh every time!</span>
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2 id="how_to_game" class="cube-title">How to play</h2>
              <p>
                <span>Start your game by clicking on the &ldquo;Play&rdquo; icon button. Browse your desired level to try out, but if this is your first time playing, it is highly recommended that you try out the first level&mdash;Stereo Madness. To control your character, use the left mouse button or press the spacebar to make it jump or descend. To progress through the level, your character needs to advance without crashing into the spikes and walls. Or else you will have to start over from the beginning of the level&mdash;it's as simple as that!</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>There are two main game modes available: Normal Mode and Practice Mode. They are identical in gameplay, except that you can set checkpoints during your attempts in Practice Mode, so you will begin from that point whenever you have to start over. However, to clear the level, a full run is needed in Normal Mode. In each level, there are three coins scattered throughout the track, most of which will require players to get off the standard track to collect them. Try to achieve all three coins in every level and show off your jumping skills!</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>As you play in later levels, your character will take numerous forms with different controls:</span>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cube form: </strong>
                  <span>The most basic form of your character. It jumps when you press the button. Holding down the button will result in it jumping continuously.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ship form: </strong>
                  <span>The first flying form of your character. To make it fly higher, hold down the button. Release the button, and it will descend automatically.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ball form: </strong>
                  <span>Your character becomes a rolling ball that switches gravity every time you press the button.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>UFO form: </strong>
                  <span>Your character can perform small hops every time you press the button (similar to the gameplay of Flappy Bird); otherwise, it descends very quickly.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Wave form:</strong>
                  <span> Your character can move upward and downward in a zigzag pattern. Hold the button to make it ascend diagonally, and release to descend.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    <strong>Robot form: </strong>
                  </strong>Your character can jump at various heights depending on how long you hold the button.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Spider form: </strong>
                  <span>Your character can teleport to the nearest overhead and switch gravity immediately whenever the button is pressed.</span>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <span>In addition, there are a myriad of options to customize your character and its forms. With over 90 colors and countless skins to choose from, your character will surely be the most unique one ever!</span>

                <li style="font-weight: 400;">
                  <strong>Prioritize completing the level first and getting the secret coins later: </strong>
                  <span>As you progress further in the levels, you will come across large yellow coins. In most cases (if not all), you will need to get off the standard path to reach them, plus some can be completely hidden from plain sight and require you to crash into what seems to be a &ldquo;wall&rdquo;. If you have yet to complete the level and are still struggling to do so, just leave them be, since trying to get to the coins makes your path a lot harder than it normally is. Additionally, since the coins only really count when you manage to collect them AND finish the level, it is best that you try to experience everything waiting for you first.</span>
                </li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;">
                  <strong>Turn off the music to concentrate better:</strong>
                  <span> The original game is well-known for its amazing soundtrack and sick beats, and our fan-made version also has the same vibe! As exciting as it may sound, sometimes the music can be quite distracting. For example, you can jump according to the rhythm in some parts, just to start over because of one part that needs off-beat jumping. What is always reliable, however, are the visual clues, so turning off the music will help you concentrate on that better. And we all know that no matter how sick the beats are, the songs will start to irritate you when your attempt counter reaches three digits.</span>
                </li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;">
                  <strong>Utilize Practice Mode: </strong>
                  <span>If you have been failing at the same part over and over again, you may want to try out Practice Mode! In this mode, you can put checkpoints in the level, so your game will begin at that point instead of the beginning. However, in order to clear the level, you will need to switch back to Normal Mode.&nbsp;</span>
                </li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;">
                  <strong>Take a break whenever you feel frustrated:</strong>
                  <span> Games like Geometric Lite can be quite challenging, and sooner or later, it can get on your nerves after a few too many attempts to finish the level. If that happens, it is recommended that you stop playing for a while, do something else, come back, and try again!</span>
                </li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;">
                  <strong>Limit your game session to clear the level more easily:</strong>
                  <span> Playing less to get better may sound counter-intuitive, but the truth is that you can&rsquo;t concentrate well with the frustration of trying too many times. If you really want to clear this one level, give it eight to ten attempts before switching to something else, so you can come back to it later with no hard feelings.</span>
